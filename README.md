This repo is dedicated to the projects I have created while following the Microsoft Certified C# Fundamentals Certification course. The base code for these projects have been developed by Microsoft. Any additional changes to the base code were made solely by me. You can view the [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/#write-your-first-code-using-c-sharp) website to view the modules and courses on the Microsoft Website.

<h2>Branching and Looping Project</h2>

Application mimicking an animal shelter application. The purpose of this project was to learn how to process data and utlize iteration statements to control the flow of the program. This application allows for the ability to:
- List all animals in the animal shelter
- Add new animals to the shelter
- Validate each animal's characteristics
- Edit each animal's characteristics
- Search for animals that match entered search terms
  
<br>

This application features:
- Combination of selection and iteration statements to implement logical workflows in accordance with supplied application data and user interactions.
- Evaluate the underlying conditions and make an informed decision when choosing between *if-else* and *switch* statements, and between *foreach*, *for*, *while*, and *do* iteration statements.
- Scope variables at an appropriate level within an application to ensure resource optimization and reduction of security footprint.
- Apply iteration statements to gather data input.
- Use data processing.
- Format data output.
- Choose the correct data types and safely converting data types.
- Create two dimensional arrays of numbers and strings.
- Search data in arrays to display or update data.
- Modify and build complex strings from multiple data sources, and format data for display across regions.

<h2>Create Methods Project</h2>

Minigame where player can move their character around in the terminal and consume food. The purpose of this application was to learn how to create and call methods. It allows for the ability to:
- Move player around in the console
- Consume "food"
- Change character appearance based on type of food
- Increase movement speed or freeze player depending on type of food player consumes
- Terminate either if an invalid key is pressed or if the terminal window is resized

<br>

This application features:
- Using Visual Studio Code to develop a C# console application that uses methods to implement logical workflows.
- Understanding existing code and make informed changes to design.
- Creating return values and methods with required and optional parameters.

<h2>Debugging and Exception Handling Project</h2>

Application mimicking the process of completing transactions in a cash register. The main takeway of this project was to learn how to use the Visual Studio Code debugger to identify and correct an issue in code logic and also to learn how to implement excpetion handling. This application allows for the ability to:
- Load a register with a set amount of $1, $5, $10, and $20 bills
- Display the amount of bills in the register
- Test with a test data set of randomly generated transaction costs and bills given
- Modify amount of transactions and range of transaction costs

<br>

This application features:
- Implement exception handling using *try-catch-throw* if customer underpays or register does not have enough bills.
- Create Exception objects that store exceptions using *throw* and call them in *catch* blocks.
- Configure launch.json to specify build and debug settings.
- Implement 2D arrays.
- Validate results by populating application with test data.
